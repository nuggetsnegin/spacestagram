# Spacetagram

Built using Create-React-App, TypeScript and Procreate for the loading gif. To run the app:

- Clone the repro
- Install depedencies using `npm i` or `npm install`
- Run the app locally using `npm start` or visit the live link(@todo)

## Future considerations

- Dynamically implement a Promise and Fetch polyfill for IE, as I used the `fetch API` which is not compatible with Internet Explorer :'(
- Infinite scrolling or date picker for loading more data from the response, currently I'm hard-coding the count
- A more professional loading gif :D
